                Have you ever wondered about the benefits of olive oil? Sure, it has
                <em>amazing</em> health benefits when eaten, but it turns out olive
                oil can be used as part of your skincare regime too.
                <strong>It’s not just for cooking anymore!</strong>

                    Olive oil is useful for hair because it can coat and protect the
                    more fragile strands and moisturize the scalp. Try:

                        Conditioning the scalp and hair ends with olive oil 10-15 minutes
                        before a shower and then wash it away with your regular shampoo.

                        Give your hair extra shine by rubbing olive oil in your hands and
                        then gently running your hands through your hair. If you want to
                        add a little scent try a few drops of tea tree, lavender, or
                        rosemary oil.

                    Olive oil can be used like lotion to cover microcracks in the skin,
                    and the benefits don’t end there:

                        Heal cracked feet by washing them, applying olive oil while the
                        feet are slightly damp, and then put on socks to hold the olive
                        oil against the skin. For the best results do this at bedtime to
                        allow the olive oil the most time to soften the skin.

                        Use olive oil as a cuticle cream or a hand lotion to sooth and

                        or flakey to get back a healthy glow.

                    It might seem strange to think about putting more oil on your face,
                    but it’s actually very beneficial when not used to excess. Olive oil
                    should be applied to a cotton ball and dabbed on the face, instead of
                    being rubbed on with fingers, to prevent clogging pores.

                        ball and dab it on eyes to breakdown waterproof components and pull
                        oil-based make-up off the face. Then follow your normal skin care
                        routine to wash, tone, and moisturize.
