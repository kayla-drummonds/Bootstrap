                    <p>
                        Summer is nearly here! We love this season because it’s the
                        perfect time to eat all the great organic vegetables from our
                        neighboring farms. One way to enjoy the delicious abundance of
                        fresh fruits and vegetables is in salads. However, at Two Trees we
                        <em>refuse</em> to eat boring, tasteless salads. Therefore, we’re
                        going to share with you the reasons to make your own, and the
                        basics for creating custom salad dressings.
                    </p>

                    <p class="h4">Make your own salad dressing</p>

                    <p>
                        Sure, the grocery store is full of salad dressings, but
                        <strong>
                            often they’re full of preservatives that impact the taste and
                            nutritional value of the dressing</strong>. Furthermore, they can sit on the shelf for a
                        long time before
                        they’re bought, which can further reduce the nutritional value of
                        the product.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To get started designing your own custom dressing, you need as
                        little as two ingredients: an oil and an acid. From there you can
                        get as creative as you like.
                    </p>

                    <p class="h4">Homemade salad dressing is good for your health</p>

                    <p>
                        Olive oil contains polyphenols which, according to research, can
                        play a role in slowing cardiovascular and neurodegenerative
                        diseases. Olive oil also has antioxidant properties. Research into
                        vinegar shows it might be slightly helpful with controlling the
                        body’s glycemic response. Together there’s no doubt, they’re
                        delicious!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We use this basic combination here in our
                        <a class="text-decoration-none" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                            href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/212896/caprese-appetizer/" target="_blank">

                        </a>
                        using mini mozzarella balls and cherry tomatoes. We serve this
                        with our basil infused olive oil and aged balsamic vinegar. It’s
                        amazing!
                    </p>

                    <p class="h4">Make it to your taste</p>

                    <p>
                        There are four main ingredient types to consider when making a
                        salad dressing: fat, acid, sweetener, and spice. For fat we
                        recommend olive oil because it carries flavor so well and it has
                        so many healthy properties, though you can definitely try
                        different oils or healthy fats like avocado.
                    </p>

                    <p class="h5">Acids</p>

                    <p>
                        The two most common acids in a salad dressing are vinegars and
                        fruit juices. You’ll want to pick the flavors that you think will
                        bring the most out of your salad components. This might require
                        some delicious experimentation!
                    </p>

                    </dl>
                    <p class="h5">Sweeteners</p>

                    <p>
                        Sugar is a common sweetener used in store-bought salad dressings.
                        However, we recommend trying a sweet fruit juice like orange or a
                        natural sweetener like agave or honey. In fact, if you want an
                        emulsifier in your dressing, honey is an excellent choice. A nice
                        benefit of making your own dressing is that you can control how
                        much added sugar is going into your food.
                    </p>
                    <p class="h5">Spice</p>

                    <p>
                        Start with salt. A little can go a long way and bring out the
                        natural sweetness in your fruits and vegetables. Experiment with
                        herbs like rosemary, mint, basil, or tarragon. If you’re wanting
                        some extra zip or an emulsifier, try Dijon mustard.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The trick to making a brilliant salad dressing is to explore
                        flavors and flavor combinations you enjoy. Take some time this
                        summer and have fun experimenting with the abundance of healthy
                        foods and flavors!
