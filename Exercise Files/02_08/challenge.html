        <h2>How We Make Our Olive Oil</h2>

        <p>Our extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) is made with equal parts love and labor, and <strong>always</strong> with
            the
            utmost
            attention to quality, purity, and flavor. The process for making EVOO, the highest available grade of olive
            oil, is not easy. EVOO is produced entirely by mechanical means, unlike refined oils which are extracted
            through the use of chemicals or heat. The oil must pass a battery of chemical tests set by the California
            Olive Oil Council (COOC), as well as other organizations, and must pass taste tests by a panel of
            professional tasters who ensure the oil tastes like olives and has no taste flaws. In short, our olive oil
            goes through a lot before it arrives at the store in those pretty bottles.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Cultivating</h3>
                <p>Our olive trees are diligently pruned, watered, and monitored for pests while the fruit is growing.
                    In
                    addition, we apply organic farming techniques to ensure we can carry the “organic” label.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Harvesting</h3>
                <p>We harvest the greener, more unripe olives, to preserve quality and nutritional value. Harvesting is
                    carried
                    out by hand shaking the trees, or by using the newer mechanical harvesters, with the main goal of
                    preventing
                    damage to the fruit.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Cleaning</h3>
                <p>Within twelve hours of picking, harvested olives are transported to the mill where they are dropped
                    into a
                    hopper and move along a conveyor belt to be washed, sorted, and cleaned of branches and leaves.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Crushing</h3>
                <p>Inside the crusher, the olives are ground into a paste to facilitate the release of oil.</p>
            </li>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>How does extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) compare to regular olive oil?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>EVOO is made from pure, cold-pressed olives and is certified as free of any defects in flavor or
                    odor, when
                    tested by a trained panel of experts. Regular olive oil is made from a blend of cold-pressed and
                    processed
                    oils.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Does olive oil get better over time?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Unlike wine, olive does not improve with age. For optimum health benefits and flavor, purchase EVOO
                    within 12
                    to 18 months of harvest, and use within six months of opening.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>How should I store olive oil?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>To preserve flavor and integrity, store olive oil in a cool, dry, dark cupboard away from heat and
                    light.
                    Store between 57 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>What are polyphenols and how are they beneficial?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Polyphenols are compounds that function as antioxidants to protect cells against unwanted
                    inflammation and
                    disease. EVOO contains higher levels of polyphenols than other olive oils.</p>
